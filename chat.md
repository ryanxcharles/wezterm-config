in wezterm, i have some key bindings set up. now, i can open a new window to the
right with `CMD+l`. however, i really want it to open the new window with a
fixed wize of 120 columns. is that possible?

```lua
return {
  -- Set up custom keybindings
  keys = {
    -- New tab: cmd+t
    { key = "t", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SpawnTab = "DefaultDomain" }) },

    -- Move right one tab: ctrl+shift+r
    { key = "l", mods = "CTRL|SHIFT", action = wezterm.action({ ActivateTabRelative = 1 }) },

    -- Move left one tab: ctrl+shift+l
    { key = "h", mods = "CTRL|SHIFT", action = wezterm.action({ ActivateTabRelative = -1 }) },

    -- Split vertical down: cmd+j
    { key = "j", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitVertical = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Split vertical up: cmd+k
    { key = "k", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitVertical = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Split horizontal right: cmd+l
    { key = "l", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitHorizontal = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Split horizontal left: cmd+h
    { key = "h", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitHorizontal = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Move right one window (rotate right): ctrl+r
    { key = "l", mods = "CTRL", action = wezterm.action({ ActivatePaneDirection = "Right" }) },

    -- Move left one window (rotate left): ctrl+l
    { key = "h", mods = "CTRL", action = wezterm.action({ ActivatePaneDirection = "Left" }) },

    -- Move up one window (rotate up): ctrl+k
    { key = "k", mods = "CTRL", action = wezterm.action({ ActivatePaneDirection = "Up" }) },

    -- Move down one window (rotate down): ctrl+j
    { key = "j", mods = "CTRL", action = wezterm.action({ ActivatePaneDirection = "Down" }) },

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, it is possible to open a new pane with a fixed width in WezTerm, but
unfortunately, the `SplitHorizontal` action does not directly support setting a
specific size (like 120 columns) when splitting. However, you can achieve this
by using a custom action with a combination of `SplitHorizontal` and
`AdjustPaneSize` or by leveraging WezTerm's event system to resize the pane
after it's created. Here's how you can approach it.

### Solution: Use a Custom Callback to Resize After Splitting

WezTerm allows you to use `action_callback` to run custom logic after an action.
You can split the pane horizontally with `CMD+l` and then immediately resize the
new pane to a specific width (approximating 120 columns). Since WezTerm's
`AdjustPaneSize` works in cells (not columns directly), you'll need to estimate
the number of cells that correspond to 120 columns based on your font size and
window size, or use a fixed cell width if your setup is consistent.

Here's how you can modify your keybinding for `CMD+l` to split horizontally and
attempt to set the new pane to a specific width:

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Other keybindings remain the same...

    -- Split horizontal right: cmd+l (with fixed width approximation)
    {
      key = "l",
      mods = "CMD",
      action = wezterm.action_callback(function(window, pane)
        -- Perform the horizontal split
        local new_pane = pane:split({ direction = "Right", domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" })
        -- Optionally, activate the new pane if desired
        window:perform_action(wezterm.action.ActivatePane(new_pane:pane_id()), pane)
        -- Attempt to resize the new pane (adjust the number of cells as needed)
        -- Note: This is an approximation since exact column width depends on font size
        window:perform_action(wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize({ "Left", 60 }), new_pane)
      end),
    },

    -- Other keybindings...
  },

  -- Other configurations...
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`pane:split`**:
   - This creates a new pane to the right of the current pane (horizontal
     split).
   - The `direction = "Right"` argument specifies the split direction.

2. **`window:perform_action`**:
   - After splitting, you can activate the new pane (optional, if you want focus
     to move to the new pane).
   - Then, `AdjustPaneSize` is used to resize the pane. Here, `"Left", 60` is a
     rough guess to shrink or expand the pane to approximate 120 columns. You'll
     need to tweak this value based on your font size and display settings since
     WezTerm uses "cells" for sizing, not exact column counts.

3. **Why Approximation?**:
   - WezTerm does not provide a direct way to set pane size in terms of columns
     because the actual width of a column depends on the font, font size, and
     display scaling. You may need to experiment with the `AdjustPaneSize` value
     (e.g., `60` cells) to get close to 120 columns in your setup.

### Alternative: Listen for Pane Creation Events

If the above approximation doesn't work well, you can listen for pane creation
events using WezTerm's event system and resize the pane after it's created.
However, this is more complex and requires tracking pane IDs or using timers to
ensure the resize happens after the split. Here's a basic example:

```lua
wezterm.on("update-right-status", function(window, pane)
  -- This is just a placeholder; you can use other events or logic to detect new panes
  -- and resize them if needed.
end)
```

For simplicity, the first approach (using `action_callback`) is recommended
unless you need very precise control.

### Notes:

- **Testing the Size**: After applying the keybinding, test with `CMD+l` and see
  if the new pane's width is close to 120 columns. Adjust the `AdjustPaneSize`
  value (e.g., change `60` to a higher or lower number) to fine-tune the width.
- **Font Size Impact**: If you change your `font_size` or display scaling, the
  number of cells corresponding to 120 columns will change, so you might need to
  recalibrate.
- **Future Updates**: Check WezTerm's documentation or GitHub issues for
  updates, as future versions might add direct support for setting pane sizes in
  columns or percentages.

If you need further assistance with fine-tuning or a more advanced event-based

# === USER ===

is there any way to just set the width of the current pane to 120 columns
directly?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Unfortunately, WezTerm does not currently provide a direct way to set the width
of a pane to a specific number of columns (like 120 columns) because pane sizing
is handled in terms of "cells" or relative proportions, and the actual width of
a column depends on factors like font size, font family, and display scaling.
However, you can approximate setting the current pane's width to 120 columns by
using the `AdjustPaneSize` action or by calculating the necessary cell count
based on your setup.

Below, I'll outline the closest approaches to achieve this in WezTerm as of the
current version (based on documentation and community resources up to October
2023). If a more direct method becomes available in future updates, it would
likely be reflected in the WezTerm documentation.

### Approach 1: Approximate Width Using `AdjustPaneSize`

You can use the `AdjustPaneSize` action to resize the current pane by a certain
number of cells, approximating the width to 120 columns. Since the exact number
of cells per column depends on your font and display settings, you'll need to
experiment with the values.

Here's how you can set up a keybinding to resize the current pane:

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Other keybindings...

    -- Resize current pane to approximate 120 columns (adjust value as needed)
    {
      key = "w",
      mods = "CMD|SHIFT", -- Example keybinding, e.g., CMD+SHIFT+W
      action = wezterm.action_callback(function(window, pane)
        -- This is a rough approximation; adjust the number of cells based on your setup
        -- For example, if 60 cells ≈ 120 columns in your font size, use that
        window:perform_action(wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize({ "Right", 60 }), pane)
        -- You may also need to adjust "Left" if the pane is on the right side of a split
      end),
    },

    -- Other keybindings...
  },

  -- Other configurations...
}
```

#### Steps to Fine-Tune:

1. **Test the Width**: Bind the action to a key (e.g., `CMD+SHIFT+W`) and press
   it to resize the pane.
2. **Check Column Count**: Run a command like `tput cols` in the terminal to see
   the actual number of columns in the resized pane.
3. **Adjust the Value**: Modify the number in `AdjustPaneSize({ "Right", 60 })`
   (e.g., increase or decrease `60`) until the pane width is close to 120
   columns.
4. **Account for Pane Position**: If the pane is on the right side of a split,
   you might need to use `"Left"` instead of `"Right"` to adjust the size
   correctly.

#### Limitations:

- This is an approximation because WezTerm doesn't map cells directly to columns
  in a configurable way.
- Changing `font_size` or display scaling (e.g., on a different monitor) will
  affect how many cells correspond to 120 columns, requiring recalibration.

### Approach 2: Use `SpawnCommand` or Scripts to Calculate Columns (Advanced)

WezTerm doesn't natively support setting pane width by columns, but you can use
a script or a spawned command to query the current terminal dimensions and
attempt to adjust the pane size dynamically. This is more complex and still
relies on approximations, but it can be more precise if you know your font's
character width.

Here's a conceptual outline:

1. **Query Terminal Size**: Use a command like `tput cols` or `stty size` to get
   the current number of columns in the pane.
2. **Calculate Adjustment**: Compare the current width to 120 columns and
   calculate how many cells to adjust.
3. **Apply Adjustment**: Use `AdjustPaneSize` via a custom action.

However, since WezTerm's Lua API doesn't directly expose a way to read the
current pane's column count or dynamically adjust based on runtime data within
the callback, this approach often requires external scripting or manual
tweaking. You can trigger a script via `SpawnCommand`, but integrating the
result back into a pane resize action is not straightforward.

### Approach 3: Request Feature or Check for Updates

Since setting pane width directly in columns isn't supported natively, you can:

- Check the [WezTerm GitHub repository](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) for open
  issues or feature requests related to pane sizing by columns.
- Submit a feature request if one doesn't exist, as the WezTerm community and
  maintainers are active and might consider adding support for column-based
  sizing.

### Practical Recommendation

For now, the simplest and most effective method is **Approach 1**:

- Add a keybinding with `AdjustPaneSize` as shown above.
- Experiment with the cell count (e.g., `60` or another value) until the pane
  width is approximately 120 columns in your current setup.
- Note that if you change monitors, font sizes, or scaling, you may need to
  adjust the value.

Here's a refined keybinding to resize the current pane (adjust direction and
size as needed):

```lua
{
  key = "w",
  mods = "CMD|SHIFT",
  action = wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize({ "Right", 60 }), -- Tweak 60 to match ~120 columns
},
```

If you have multiple splits and need to handle different pane positions (left or
right side), you can expand the logic in a callback to check the pane's
neighbors using `pane:get_pane()` or similar methods to determine which
direction to adjust.

### Additional Notes

- **Font Size Impact**: In your config, you have `font_size = 11`. If this
  changes, the cell-to-column ratio will change, so keep that in mind.
- **Display Scaling**: If you use WezTerm across different monitors or DPI
  settings, the approximation might vary.
- **Community Help**: If you're still struggling to get the right width,
  consider asking in the WezTerm Discussions or Discord for advice on
  calculating cells-to-columns for your specific setup.

# === USER ===

does wezterm have a "select mode" like tmux where you can select text and copy
it to the clipboard? if so, how do i enable it?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, WezTerm does have a feature similar to tmux's "select mode" or "copy mode,"
which allows you to select and copy text from the terminal buffer using the
keyboard or mouse. In WezTerm, this is referred to as **Quick Select Mode** or
simply the selection functionality tied to the scrollback buffer. You can
navigate the scrollback, select text, and copy it to the clipboard.

WezTerm's selection and copy functionality is built-in and does not require
explicit "enabling" in the same way tmux's copy mode does. However, you can
customize the keybindings and behavior to make it more accessible or to mimic
tmux's workflow. Below, I'll explain how it works by default and how to
customize it to suit your needs.

### Default Selection and Copy Behavior in WezTerm

1. **Mouse Selection**:
   - By default, you can click and drag with the mouse to select text in
     WezTerm. The selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard (on
     most platforms like macOS, Windows, and Linux with a clipboard manager).
   - You can also hold `Shift` while clicking and dragging to override any mouse
     bindings and force a selection.

2. **Keyboard Navigation (Scrollback)**:
   - Use `Shift + UpArrow` or `Shift + DownArrow` to scroll through the terminal
     buffer line by line.
   - Use `Shift + PageUp` or `Shift + PageDown` to scroll by pages.
   - These actions allow you to view past output, but selection with the
     keyboard requires entering a specific mode or using custom keybindings (see
     below).

3. **Quick Select Mode**:
   - WezTerm provides a `QuickSelect` action that lets you jump to predefined
     patterns (like URLs or file paths) and select them for copying.
   - By default, this isn't bound to a key, but you can assign it (more on this
     below).

4. **Copy and Paste**:
   - Once text is selected (via mouse or keyboard), you can copy it to the
     clipboard with `CMD + C` (macOS) or `Ctrl + C` (Windows/Linux, depending on
     your setup).
   - Paste from the clipboard using `CMD + V` or `Ctrl + V`.

### Entering a tmux-like "Copy Mode"

WezTerm does not have an exact equivalent to tmux's copy mode (where you enter a
distinct mode to navigate and select text with keyboard commands), but you can
emulate it by leveraging the `ScrollToPrompt`, `QuickSelect`, or custom
keybindings to navigate the scrollback buffer and select text.

To start selecting text with the keyboard, you can use the `StartSelection`
action (if supported in your version) or rely on mouse selection combined with
keyboard scrolling. However, the most tmux-like experience comes from binding
keys to navigate the scrollback and copy text.

### Customizing Keybindings for a tmux-like Copy Mode

You can set up keybindings in your WezTerm configuration to mimic tmux's copy
mode behavior. Below is an example of how to create a simple "select mode"
workflow where you can scroll, select, and copy text using the keyboard.

Add the following to your `wezterm.lua` configuration file (typically located at
`~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua`):

```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

return {
  -- Other configurations...

  keys = {
    -- Other keybindings...

    -- Enter a "copy mode" by scrolling up with a custom keybinding
    { key = "[", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action.ScrollByPage(-1) }, -- Scroll up (like tmux prefix + [)
    { key = "]", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action.ScrollByPage(1) },  -- Scroll down

    -- Scroll line by line in the buffer
    { key = "UpArrow", mods = "SHIFT", action = wezterm.action.ScrollByLine(-1) },
    { key = "DownArrow", mods = "SHIFT", action = wezterm.action.ScrollByLine(1) },

    -- QuickSelect to jump to selectable items (like URLs or paths)
    { key = "q", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action.QuickSelect },

    -- Copy selected text to clipboard (if text is selected via mouse or QuickSelect)
    { key = "c", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action.CopyTo("Clipboard") },

    -- Paste from clipboard
    { key = "v", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action.PasteFrom("Clipboard") },
  },

  -- Enable QuickSelect for specific patterns (optional customization)
  quick_select_patterns = {
    -- Default patterns for URLs, file paths, etc.
    -- You can add custom regex patterns here if needed
  },

  -- Other configurations...
}
```

### Explanation of Keybindings

- **`CMD + [` and `CMD + ]`**: Mimics tmux's prefix + `[` to enter copy mode by
  scrolling up a page. Use `]` to scroll back down.
- **`SHIFT + UpArrow/DownArrow`**: Scrolls line by line through the buffer,
  allowing you to navigate to the text you want to select.
- **`CMD + q`**: Triggers `QuickSelect`, which highlights selectable items (like
  URLs or file paths) that you can copy.
- **`CMD + c` and `CMD + v`**: Standard copy and paste to/from the clipboard.

### Limitations Compared to tmux Copy Mode

- **Keyboard Selection**: Unlike tmux, WezTerm does not currently have a
  built-in mode where you can move a cursor with keys (like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`)
  to select arbitrary text without a mouse. You can navigate the scrollback with
  the keyboard, but actual selection often requires the mouse or `QuickSelect`.
- **Workaround**: Use the mouse to select text after scrolling to the desired
  location with keyboard bindings, or rely on `QuickSelect` for specific
  patterns.

### Enabling Mouse Selection (if Disabled)

If mouse selection isn't working, ensure that mouse bindings aren't overriding
the default behavior. By default, WezTerm allows mouse selection, but you can
explicitly enable or customize it in your config:

```lua
return {
  -- Other configurations...

  -- Ensure mouse selection works (optional, as this is default)
  mouse_bindings = {
    {
      event = { Down = { streak = 1, button = "Left" } },
      mods = "NONE",
      action = wezterm.action.SelectTextAtMouseCursor("Cell"),
    },
    {
      event = { Drag = { streak = 1, button = "Left" } },
      mods = "NONE",
      action = wezterm.action.ExtendSelectionToMouseCursor("Cell"),
    },
    {
      event = { Up = { streak = 1, button = "Left" } },
      mods = "NONE",
      action = wezterm.action.CompleteSelection("ClipboardAndPrimarySelection"),
    },
  },
}
```

This ensures clicking and dragging with the left mouse button selects text and
copies it to the clipboard upon release.

### Additional Tips

- **Check Clipboard Integration**: Ensure your system clipboard is accessible by
  WezTerm. On Linux, you might need a clipboard manager like `xclip` or
  `wl-clipboard` (for Wayland). On macOS and Windows, clipboard integration
  works out of the box.
- **Custom Patterns for QuickSelect**: If you often select specific types of
  text, customize `quick_select_patterns` in your config to match regex patterns
  for those items.
- **Future Updates**: WezTerm is actively developed, so check the
  [documentation](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) or
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) for new features related
  to keyboard-driven selection modes.

### Summary

WezTerm doesn't have an exact "select mode" like tmux, but it provides
scrollback navigation, mouse selection, and `QuickSelect` to achieve similar
functionality. By customizing keybindings, you can create a workflow that
approximates tmux's copy mode. If you need true keyboard-driven text selection
(without a mouse), you might need to submit a feature request to the WezTerm
project or use tmux within WezTerm for that specific functionality.

# === USER ===

does wezterm have any other types of windows other than tabs and panes and
entire terminals? e.g., can i have a "hidden tab"?

# === ASSISTANT ===

In WezTerm, the primary organizational structures for managing terminal sessions
are **tabs**, **panes**, and **windows** (entire terminal instances). These
correspond to the typical terminal multiplexer concepts: tabs for multiple
sessions within a window, panes for splitting a tab into multiple terminal
views, and windows for separate terminal instances. However, WezTerm does not
natively support additional types of "windows" or concepts like "hidden tabs" in
the way some other terminal multiplexers or editors might (e.g., tmux's hidden
sessions or detached windows).

Below, I'll clarify the structures WezTerm offers, address the concept of a
"hidden tab" or similar feature, and explore potential workarounds or related
functionality.

### WezTerm's Core Structures

1. **Windows**:
   - A WezTerm window is a top-level application window (an entire terminal
     instance).
   - Each window can contain multiple tabs.
   - You can create a new window with a keybinding like `SpawnWindow` (e.g.,
     bind it to `CMD+n`).

2. **Tabs**:
   - Tabs exist within a window and represent individual terminal sessions or
     groups of panes.
   - You can create new tabs with `SpawnTab` (e.g., `CMD+t` in your config) and
     navigate between them.
   - Tabs are visible by default in the tab bar at the top (or bottom, depending
     on configuration).

3. **Panes**:
   - Panes are splits within a single tab, allowing multiple terminal views side
     by side or stacked.
   - You can split panes horizontally or vertically (e.g., `CMD+l` for
     horizontal split in your config).

These are the primary constructs in WezTerm, and there are no additional "types"
of windows or hidden structures natively supported beyond these.

### Does WezTerm Support "Hidden Tabs" or Similar Concepts?

WezTerm does not have a built-in concept of a "hidden tab" (a tab that exists
but is not visible in the tab bar) or other types of windows beyond the ones
mentioned. Unlike tmux, which allows "detached sessions" (background sessions
you can reattach to later), WezTerm's tabs, panes, and windows are all
foreground entities tied to the current instance of the application.

However, let's explore related features or workarounds to achieve something
similar to a "hidden tab" or alternative window type:

#### 1. **Background Processes or Domains (Not Hidden Tabs)**

- WezTerm supports "domains" for managing terminal sessions, but these are not
  hidden tabs. For example, you can spawn a tab in a different domain (like a
  remote SSH session), but it still appears in the tab bar.
- If you want something to run in the background without a visible tab, you
  would need to use an external tool like tmux or screen within a WezTerm pane
  to manage detached sessions.

#### 2. **Minimizing or Hiding Windows**

- While not a "hidden tab," you can create a new WezTerm window (via
  `SpawnWindow`) and minimize it or move it to a different workspace/desktop (on
  macOS/Linux/Windows). This effectively hides the content from your current
  view without closing it.
- Example keybinding to spawn a new window:
  ```lua
  { key = "n", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action.SpawnWindow },
  ```
- This isn't a tab-specific solution but can simulate hiding content by
  isolating it in a separate window.

#### 3. **Tab Visibility and Customization**

- WezTerm allows you to hide the tab bar entirely or customize its appearance
  via the `hide_tab_bar_if_only_one_tab` or `use_fancy_tab_bar` settings in your
  configuration. However, this doesn't hide individual tabs—it affects the
  entire tab bar.
- Example configuration to hide the tab bar if there's only one tab:
  ```lua
  return {
    hide_tab_bar_if_only_one_tab = true,
    -- Other settings...
  }
  ```
- There is no option to hide specific tabs while keeping others visible.

#### 4. **Workaround: Use tmux or screen Within WezTerm for Hidden Sessions**

- If you specifically need "hidden" or background sessions (like tmux's detached
  sessions), you can run tmux or screen inside a WezTerm pane or tab. Then,
  detach from a tmux session to "hide" it while it continues running in the
  background.
- Steps:
  1. Start tmux in a WezTerm tab (`tmux new-session`).
  2. Create your session content.
  3. Detach from tmux (default: `Ctrl+b`, then `d`).
  4. The tmux session runs in the background, and you can close the WezTerm tab
     if desired (as long as the tmux server is running elsewhere or persists).
  5. Reattach later with `tmux attach` in a new WezTerm tab.
- This is the closest equivalent to a "hidden tab" since WezTerm itself doesn't
  manage hidden content.

#### 5. **Workspaces (Limited Similarity)**

- WezTerm supports a concept called "workspaces," which are logical groupings of
  tabs and panes within a window. However, workspaces are not hidden; they are
  just a way to organize and switch between sets of tabs.
- You can switch workspaces with keybindings like `SwitchToWorkspace`, but this
  doesn't hide content—it just changes the active context.
- Example keybinding:
  ```lua
  { key = "9", mods = "ALT", action = wezterm.action.SwitchToWorkspace({ name = "my-workspace" }) },
  ```

### Can You Simulate a "Hidden Tab"?

While WezTerm doesn't natively support hidden tabs, here are a few practical
workarounds to achieve similar behavior:

1. **Rename and Ignore Tabs**:
   - Rename a tab to something like "Hidden" or "Background" (using a keybinding
     like `CTRL+SHIFT+t` in your config) and avoid interacting with it. This
     doesn't hide it but visually separates it from active tabs.
   - This is purely cosmetic and relies on user discipline.

2. **Move Tabs to a Separate Window and Minimize**:
   - Spawn a new tab, then move it to a new window if needed (WezTerm doesn't
     directly support moving tabs between windows currently, so you might need
     to recreate the session in a new window).
   - Minimize the window or move it off-screen to "hide" it.

3. **Use tmux for Background Management**:
   - As mentioned earlier, running tmux inside WezTerm is the most robust way to
     manage hidden or background sessions.

### Future Features or Community Input

WezTerm is actively developed, and new features are often added based on
community feedback. If a "hidden tab" or additional window type is critical to
your workflow, consider:

- Checking the [WezTerm GitHub repository](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) for
  open issues or feature requests related to hidden tabs or background sessions.
- Submitting a feature request if one doesn't exist.

### Summary

WezTerm does not currently support "hidden tabs" or additional types of windows
beyond tabs, panes, and top-level windows. The closest workarounds involve
minimizing separate windows, using tmux or screen for background sessions, or
cosmetically organizing tabs to deprioritize them. If your use case for a
"hidden tab" is specific (e.g., running a background task or temporarily
stashing a session), the tmux workaround is likely the most effective.

If you have a specific scenario in mind for why you need a hidden tab or another
type of window, let me know, and I can help tailor a more precise workaround or
keybinding setup!

# === USER ===

are there any replacements for tmux that are written in rust?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, there are several replacements or alternatives to `tmux` that are written
in Rust. These tools aim to provide terminal multiplexing capabilities similar
to `tmux` (managing multiple terminal sessions, panes, and windows) while
leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and modern design principles. Below, I'll
outline some notable `tmux` alternatives written in Rust, along with their
features, maturity, and how they compare to `tmux`.

### 1. **Zellij**

- **Overview**: Zellij is one of the most prominent `tmux` alternatives written
  in Rust. It is a terminal workspace manager designed to be user-friendly, with
  a focus on simplicity and modern features out of the box.
- **Key Features**:
  - Built-in layouts for quick workspace setup (e.g., editor + terminal split).
  - Pane and tab management with keyboard-driven navigation.
  - Session persistence (can reattach to sessions after closing).
  - Floating panes for temporary overlays (like pop-up terminals).
  - Mouse support for resizing and selecting panes.
  - Customizable keybindings and themes.
  - Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Comparison to tmux**:
  - Zellij is more opinionated than `tmux`, offering a polished default
    experience without requiring extensive configuration.
  - Unlike `tmux`, it has a built-in status bar and UI elements by default.
  - It supports session detachment and reattachment, similar to `tmux`.
  - Less mature ecosystem for plugins compared to `tmux`.
- **Maturity**: Actively maintained, with a growing user base. Stable for most
  use cases as of late 2023.
- **Installation**: Available via Cargo (`cargo install zellij`), Homebrew
  (`brew install zellij`), or pre-built binaries from their
  [GitHub releases](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij).
- **Why Choose It?**: If you want a modern, batteries-included multiplexer with
  a focus on usability and don't need the extensive customization of `tmux`.

### 2. **rusty-tmux (Experimental/Less Known)**

- **Overview**: `rusty-tmux` is a less widely known project that aims to be a
  direct reimplementation of `tmux` in Rust. It is not as mature or
  feature-complete as Zellij or `tmux` itself.
- **Key Features**:
  - Attempts to mimic `tmux` commands and behavior.
  - Basic session, window, and pane management.
- **Comparison to tmux**:
  - Far less feature-complete than `tmux` or Zellij.
  - Limited documentation and community support.
- **Maturity**: Experimental and not recommended for production use. Development
  appears sporadic based on available repositories (e.g., on GitHub).
- **Installation**: May require building from source if a repository is found
  (e.g., via Cargo).
- **Why Choose It?**: Only if you're specifically looking for a Rust-based
  project that closely mirrors `tmux` and are willing to contribute to or
  tolerate incomplete functionality.

### 3. **Other Rust-Based Terminal Tools (Related but Not Direct Replacements)**

While not full `tmux` replacements, some Rust projects provide overlapping
functionality or could be used in conjunction with other tools:

- **Alacritty with Custom Scripting**:
  - Alacritty, a popular Rust-based terminal emulator, doesn't replace `tmux`
    but can be paired with shell scripts or other multiplexers for session
    management.
  - It lacks built-in pane/window management but focuses on performance.
- **WezTerm (Rust-Based Terminal Emulator)**:
  - Since you're already using WezTerm (which is written in Rust), it offers
    built-in tab and pane management, as discussed in previous responses.
  - While not a full `tmux` replacement (e.g., no detached sessions by default),
    it covers many use cases for multiplexing directly within the terminal
    emulator.
  - You can extend its functionality with tmux running inside it for session
    persistence.
  - **Why Choose It?**: If you're happy with WezTerm's pane and tab system, you
    might not need a separate multiplexer like `tmux` or Zellij unless you
    require detached sessions.

### Comparison Table

| Tool           | Language | Session Persistence           | Customizability   | Maturity        | Ease of Use               | Cross-Platform |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| **tmux**       | C        | Yes (detach/attach)           | High (via config) | Very Mature     | Moderate (learning curve) | Yes            |

| **rusty-tmux** | Rust     | Partial (if implemented)      | Low               | Experimental    | Low (incomplete)          | Unknown        |
| **WezTerm**    | Rust     | No (unless using tmux inside) | High (via Lua)    | Mature          | High (GUI + config)       | Yes            |

### Recommendation: Zellij as the Primary tmux Alternative in Rust

Among the Rust-based alternatives, **Zellij** stands out as the most viable and
feature-rich replacement for `tmux`. Here's why you might consider it over
`tmux` or other tools:

- **Rust Benefits**: Written in Rust, it offers memory safety and potentially
  better performance than `tmux` (though `tmux` is already very lightweight).
- **Modern Design**: Zellij provides a more intuitive default experience with
  preconfigured layouts and a status bar, reducing the need for extensive setup
  compared to `tmux`.
- **Session Management**: Like `tmux`, it supports detaching and reattaching to
  sessions, which is a key feature missing in terminal emulators like WezTerm
  alone.
- **Integration with WezTerm**: You can run Zellij inside WezTerm, combining
  WezTerm's excellent terminal rendering and customization with Zellij's
  multiplexing and session persistence.

#### Getting Started with Zellij

1. **Install Zellij**:
   - Via Cargo: `cargo install zellij`
   - Via Homebrew (macOS): `brew install zellij`
   - Or download binaries from
     [Zellij GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/releases).

2. **Run Zellij**:
   - Start it with `zellij` in your terminal (e.g., inside WezTerm).
   - Use default keybindings (e.g., `Ctrl+p` for pane management) or customize
     them via `~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`.

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Detach from a session with `Ctrl+q` (or configured key).
   - Reattach with `zellij attach <session-name>` or list sessions with
     `zellij ls`.

4. **Customization**:
   - Edit the config file (`~/.config/zellij/config.kdl`) to adjust keybindings,
     themes, and layouts.

### When to Stick with tmux

If you're already comfortable with `tmux`, have a heavily customized setup, or
rely on its vast plugin ecosystem (e.g., `tmux-resurrect` or `tmux-continuum`),
you might prefer to keep using it inside WezTerm. `tmux` is battle-tested,
widely supported, and has a larger community for troubleshooting. You can still
benefit from Rust-based tools like WezTerm for the terminal emulator while
running `tmux` for multiplexing.

### Additional Resources and Future Projects

- **Check for New Projects**: Rust's ecosystem is growing rapidly, so new
  terminal multiplexers might emerge. Search GitHub with terms like "Rust
  terminal multiplexer" or "Rust tmux alternative" for the latest projects.
- **Contribute or Request Features**: If Zellij or another tool is close to your
  needs but missing features, consider contributing (since they're open-source)
  or filing feature requests.
- **Rust Community**: The Rust community on Reddit (`r/rust`) or Discord often
  discusses terminal tools, so you might find recommendations or beta projects
  there.

### Summary

- **Zellij** is the leading Rust-based alternative to `tmux`, offering a modern,
  user-friendly experience with session persistence and pane management.
- Other Rust projects like `rusty-tmux` exist but are experimental and not ready
  for general use.
- WezTerm (already in use by you) provides built-in multiplexing but lacks
  detached session support unless paired with `tmux` or Zellij.
- If session detachment or a `tmux`-like workflow is critical, Zellij is the
  best Rust option to try.
