in wezterm, i have some key bindings set up. now, i can open a new window to the right with `CMD+l`. however, i really want it to open the new window with a fixed wize of 120 columns. is that possible?

```lua
return {
  -- Set up custom keybindings
  keys = {
    -- New tab: cmd+t
    { key = "t", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SpawnTab = "DefaultDomain" }) },

    -- Move right one tab: ctrl+shift+r
    { key = "l", mods = "CTRL|SHIFT", action = wezterm.action({ ActivateTabRelative = 1 }) },

    -- Move left one tab: ctrl+shift+l
    { key = "h", mods = "CTRL|SHIFT", action = wezterm.action({ ActivateTabRelative = -1 }) },

    -- Split vertical down: cmd+j
    { key = "j", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitVertical = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Split vertical up: cmd+k
    { key = "k", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitVertical = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Split horizontal right: cmd+l
    { key = "l", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitHorizontal = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Split horizontal left: cmd+h
    { key = "h", mods = "CMD", action = wezterm.action({ SplitHorizontal = { domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" } }) },

    -- Move right one window (rotate right): ctrl+r
    { key = "l", mods = "CTRL", action = wezterm.action({ ActivatePaneDirection = "Right" }) },

    -- Move left one window (rotate left): ctrl+l

Yes, it is possible to open a new pane with a fixed width in WezTerm, but unfortunately, the `SplitHorizontal` action does not directly support setting a specific size (like 120 columns) when splitting. However, you can achieve this by using a custom action with a combination of `SplitHorizontal` and `AdjustPaneSize` or by leveraging WezTerm's event system to resize the pane after it's created. Here's how you can approach it.

### Solution: Use a Custom Callback to Resize After Splitting

WezTerm allows you to use `action_callback` to run custom logic after an action. You can split the pane horizontally with `CMD+l` and then immediately resize the new pane to a specific width (approximating 120 columns). Since WezTerm's `AdjustPaneSize` works in cells (not columns directly), you'll need to estimate the number of cells that correspond to 120 columns based on your font size and window size, or use a fixed cell width if your setup is consistent.

Here's how you can modify your keybinding for `CMD+l` to split horizontally and attempt to set the new pane to a specific width:

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Other keybindings remain the same...

    -- Split horizontal right: cmd+l (with fixed width approximation)
    {
      key = "l",
      mods = "CMD",
      action = wezterm.action_callback(function(window, pane)
        -- Perform the horizontal split
        local new_pane = pane:split({ direction = "Right", domain = "CurrentPaneDomain" })
        -- Optionally, activate the new pane if desired
        window:perform_action(wezterm.action.ActivatePane(new_pane:pane_id()), pane)
        -- Attempt to resize the new pane (adjust the number of cells as needed)
        -- Note: This is an approximation since exact column width depends on font size
        window:perform_action(wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize({ "Left", 60 }), new_pane)
      end),
    },

    -- Other keybindings...
  },

  -- Other configurations...
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`pane:split`**:
   - This creates a new pane to the right of the current pane (horizontal split).
   - The `direction = "Right"` argument specifies the split direction.

2. **`window:perform_action`**:
   - After splitting, you can activate the new pane (optional, if you want focus to move to the new pane).
   - Then, `AdjustPaneSize` is used to resize the pane. Here, `"Left", 60` is a rough guess to shrink or expand the pane to approximate 120 columns. You'll need to tweak this value based on your font size and display settings since WezTerm uses "cells" for sizing, not exact column counts.

3. **Why Approximation?**:
   - WezTerm does not provide a direct way to set pane size in terms of columns because the actual width of a column depends on the font, font size, and display scaling. You may need to experiment with the `AdjustPaneSize` value (e.g., `60` cells) to get close to 120 columns in your setup.

### Alternative: Listen for Pane Creation Events
If the above approximation doesn't work well, you can listen for pane creation events using WezTerm's event system and resize the pane after it's created. However, this is more complex and requires tracking pane IDs or using timers to ensure the resize happens after the split. Here's a basic example:

```lua
wezterm.on("update-right-status", function(window, pane)
  -- This is just a placeholder; you can use other events or logic to detect new panes
  -- and resize them if needed.
end)
```

For simplicity, the first approach (using `action_callback`) is recommended unless you need very precise control.

### Notes:
- **Testing the Size**: After applying the keybinding, test with `CMD+l` and see if the new pane's width is close to 120 columns. Adjust the `AdjustPaneSize` value (e.g., change `60` to a higher or lower number) to fine-tune the width.
- **Font Size Impact**: If you change your `font_size` or display scaling, the number of cells corresponding to 120 columns will change, so you might need to recalibrate.
- **Future Updates**: Check WezTerm's documentation or GitHub issues for updates, as future versions might add direct support for setting pane sizes in columns or percentages.

is there any way to just set the width of the current pane to 120 columns directly?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Unfortunately, WezTerm does not currently provide a direct way to set the width of a pane to a specific number of columns (like 120 columns) because pane sizing is handled in terms of "cells" or relative proportions, and the actual width of a column depends on factors like font size, font family, and display scaling. However, you can approximate setting the current pane's width to 120 columns by using the `AdjustPaneSize` action or by calculating the necessary cell count based on your setup.

Below, I'll outline the closest approaches to achieve this in WezTerm as of the current version (based on documentation and community resources up to October 2023). If a more direct method becomes available in future updates, it would likely be reflected in the WezTerm documentation.

### Approach 1: Approximate Width Using `AdjustPaneSize`
You can use the `AdjustPaneSize` action to resize the current pane by a certain number of cells, approximating the width to 120 columns. Since the exact number of cells per column depends on your font and display settings, you'll need to experiment with the values.

Here's how you can set up a keybinding to resize the current pane:

```lua
return {
  keys = {
    -- Other keybindings...

    -- Resize current pane to approximate 120 columns (adjust value as needed)
    {
      key = "w",
      mods = "CMD|SHIFT", -- Example keybinding, e.g., CMD+SHIFT+W
      action = wezterm.action_callback(function(window, pane)
        -- This is a rough approximation; adjust the number of cells based on your setup
        -- For example, if 60 cells ≈ 120 columns in your font size, use that
        window:perform_action(wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize({ "Right", 60 }), pane)
        -- You may also need to adjust "Left" if the pane is on the right side of a split
      end),
    },

    -- Other keybindings...
  },

  -- Other configurations...
}
```

#### Steps to Fine-Tune:
1. **Test the Width**: Bind the action to a key (e.g., `CMD+SHIFT+W`) and press it to resize the pane.
2. **Check Column Count**: Run a command like `tput cols` in the terminal to see the actual number of columns in the resized pane.
3. **Adjust the Value**: Modify the number in `AdjustPaneSize({ "Right", 60 })` (e.g., increase or decrease `60`) until the pane width is close to 120 columns.
4. **Account for Pane Position**: If the pane is on the right side of a split, you might need to use `"Left"` instead of `"Right"` to adjust the size correctly.

#### Limitations:
- This is an approximation because WezTerm doesn't map cells directly to columns in a configurable way.
- Changing `font_size` or display scaling (e.g., on a different monitor) will affect how many cells correspond to 120 columns, requiring recalibration.

### Approach 2: Use `SpawnCommand` or Scripts to Calculate Columns (Advanced)
WezTerm doesn't natively support setting pane width by columns, but you can use a script or a spawned command to query the current terminal dimensions and attempt to adjust the pane size dynamically. This is more complex and still relies on approximations, but it can be more precise if you know your font's character width.

Here's a conceptual outline:
1. **Query Terminal Size**: Use a command like `tput cols` or `stty size` to get the current number of columns in the pane.
2. **Calculate Adjustment**: Compare the current width to 120 columns and calculate how many cells to adjust.
3. **Apply Adjustment**: Use `AdjustPaneSize` via a custom action.

However, since WezTerm's Lua API doesn't directly expose a way to read the current pane's column count or dynamically adjust based on runtime data within the callback, this approach often requires external scripting or manual tweaking. You can trigger a script via `SpawnCommand`, but integrating the result back into a pane resize action is not straightforward.

### Approach 3: Request Feature or Check for Updates
Since setting pane width directly in columns isn't supported natively, you can:
- Check the [WezTerm GitHub repository](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) for open issues or feature requests related to pane sizing by columns.
- Submit a feature request if one doesn't exist, as the WezTerm community and maintainers are active and might consider adding support for column-based sizing.

### Practical Recommendation
For now, the simplest and most effective method is **Approach 1**:
- Add a keybinding with `AdjustPaneSize` as shown above.
- Experiment with the cell count (e.g., `60` or another value) until the pane width is approximately 120 columns in your current setup.
- Note that if you change monitors, font sizes, or scaling, you may need to adjust the value.

Here's a refined keybinding to resize the current pane (adjust direction and size as needed):

```lua
{
  key = "w",
  mods = "CMD|SHIFT",
  action = wezterm.action.AdjustPaneSize({ "Right", 60 }), -- Tweak 60 to match ~120 columns
},
```

If you have multiple splits and need to handle different pane positions (left or right side), you can expand the logic in a callback to check the pane's neighbors using `pane:get_pane()` or similar methods to determine which direction to adjust.

### Additional Notes
- **Font Size Impact**: In your config, you have `font_size = 11`. If this changes, the cell-to-column ratio will change, so keep that in mind.
- **Display Scaling**: If you use WezTerm across different monitors or DPI settings, the approximation might vary.
- **Community Help**: If you're still struggling to get the right width, consider asking in the WezTerm Discussions or Discord for advice on calculating cells-to-columns for your specific setup.
